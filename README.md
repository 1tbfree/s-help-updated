# s-help-updated
A updated s!help for Node.js and ran with BonziWORLD FE, PopeWORLD, DonutWORLD, BonziWORLD Revived Constructed, GeriWORLD, BonziWORLD Remastered, BonziWORLD NE, JosephWORLD, BonziWORLD Revived, BonziWORLD 2, bonzi.erik.red and much more.
But they have many limitations to disable or enable by using s!tool.
Specify works only in BonziWORLD.

BWR is now in quarantine zone, you can talk only here or ics will remember you and ban you then she attacks your ip address. Now perhaps you gonna to change your ip address after the armstrong cable has a attack; your repetition is similarly unacceptable.

## How to install?
To install this following:
extract the file or use Git to compile
```
cd %Userprofile%\Documents\s-help-update-master
npm install -f
```
The hyphen on command ```-f``` is a force.
